why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so

He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants

“Why,” says he, ‘a magician could call up a lot of genies,
and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say
Jack Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around
asa chureh.”

“Well,” I says, “s'pose we got some genies to help ws—
can’t we lick the other erowd then ?”

«How you going to get them ?”

“T don't know. How do they get them ?”

“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then
the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-
ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything thé
told to do they up and do it. ‘They don't think nothing of

palling a shot tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday
‘school superintendent over the head with it-—or any other man.”

“Who makes them tear around so?”

“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong
to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do
whatever he says. If he tells them to build a palace forty
miles long, out of di'monds, and fill it fall of chewing gum, or

He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out.
He says :

“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”

I says, “Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.
You'll take it—won’t you?”

He says:

“Well, I'm puzzled. Ts something the matter ?”

“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing—then
I won't have to tell no lies.’

He studied a while, and then he says:

“Oho-o, I think I see. You want to sell all your pro-

Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your
fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox,
and he used to do magic with it. He said there was a spirit
inside of it, and it knowed everything, So I went to him that
night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks
in the snow. What I wanted to know, was, what. he was going
todo, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-ball,
and ssid something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
iton the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about. an

just the same. Jim got down on his knees and put his ear

, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others.
Well, nobody could think of anything to do—everybody was
stumped, and set still, Iwas most ready to crys but all at
once I thought of a way, and so T offered them Miss Watson—
they could kill her. Everybody said

“Oh, she'll do, she'll do. ‘That’s all right. Huck ean
come in,”

‘Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get. blood to
sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.

“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “ what's the line of business of
this Gang?”

“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.

“But who are we going to rob? houses—or cattle—

or.

“Stuff! stealing cattle and such tIfings ain't robbery,
burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. “We ain't burglars, ‘That ain't
no sort of style, We are highwaymen, We stop stages and
carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and
take their watches and money.”

“Must we always kill the people?”

“Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think diffe-
rent, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them. Except some
‘that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they're
ransomed.

“Ransomed? What's that ?”

“TI don't know. But that’s what they do. I've seen it in
books; and so of course that’s what we've got to do.”

But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?

«Why blame it all, we've got to do it. Don't I tell you it’s
in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from
what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”

“Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in
the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't


know how to do it to them ? that's the thing J want to get at.
Now what do you reckon it is?”

“Well, I don’t know. But per'aps if we keep them till
they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead.”

“Now, that’s something like. That'll answer. Why couldn't
yon suid that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed
to death—and a bothersome lot they'll be, too, eating up every-
thing and always trying to get loose.”

“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when
there's a gnard over them, ready to shoot them down if they
move a peg ?”

“A guanl. Well, that ix good. So somebody's got to set
upall night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.
Tthink that's foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and
ransom them as soon as they get here?”

“Because it ain't in the books so—that’s why. Now Ben
Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?
that’s the iden. Don't you reckon that the people that made
the books knows what's the correct thing to do? Do you
reckon you can learn ‘em anything? Not by a good deal.
No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”

“All right. I don’t mind; but I say it's a fool way, any-
how. Say—do we kill the women, too?”

“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't
let on, Kill the women? No—nobody ever saw anything in
the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you're
always as polite as pie to them; and by-and-by they fall in
love with you and never want to go home any more.”

“Well, if that’s the way, I’m agreed, but I don’t take no
Mock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up
ith women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that: there
won't be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got
nothing to say.”


‘not come out again until al the dwarves had gone away.
Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had
stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shin-
ing in the dark.

“Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a tone that
seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the
hobbit’s mind.

“What about a little light?” Ibo apologetically.

“We like the dark,” said all the dwarves. “Dark for
dark business! There are many hours before dawn.”

“Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He
missed the stool and satin the fender, knocking over the
poker and shovel with a crash.

“Hush!” said Gandalf. “Let Thorin speak!” And this
is how Thorin began.

“Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are met
together in the house of our friend and fellow conspira-
tor, this most excellent and audacious hobbit—may the
hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and
ale!—* He paused for breath and for a polite remark
from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite lost on
poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in
protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow
conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flum-
moxed. So Thorin went on:

“We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means,
policy and devices. We shall soon before the break of day
start on our long journey, a journey from which some of

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall

Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,

To win our harps and gold from him!

As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things
made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving,
through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the
hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up
inside him, and he wished to go and see the great moun-
tains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and
explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-
stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in
a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of
the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the
wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up—probably
somebody lighting a wood-fire—and he thought of plun-
dering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all
to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain
Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again,

He got up trembling, He had less than half a mind to
fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to,
and go and hide behind the beer-barrels in the cellar, and

Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves,
and with Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a
beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin steuck it the
rmusie began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo
forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark
lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very
far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill.

The dark came into the room from the little window
that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flick-
ered—it was April—and still they played on, while the
shadow of Gandalf’s beard wagged against the wall

The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down,
and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And
suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they
played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep
places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment
of their song, if it ean be like their song without their
musie.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The deoarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fel like ringing bells

In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fell.

‘And of course they did none of these dreadful things,
and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as
lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round
in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were
doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his
feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the
‘most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to
0, it went—up the chimney, or behind the clock on the
mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round the
ceilings but wherever it went it was not quick enough to
escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from
his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin’s.
Then Gandalf’s smoke-ring would go green and come
back to hover over the wizard’s head. He had a cloud of
them about him already, and in the dim light it made him
look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and
watched —he loved smoke-rings—and then he blushed to
think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the
smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill.
“Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring out the

instruments!

Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back
little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out flutes
from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a
drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and
came back with clarinets that they had left among the
walking-sticks. Dwalin and Balin said: “Excuse me, [left
mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with you!” said

“Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!” Gandalf
called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to the
pantries. “And just bring out the cold chicken and
pickles!”

“Seems to know as much about the inside of my
larders as T do myself!” thought Mr. Baggins, who was
feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to
wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not
come right into his house. By the time he had got all the
bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and
plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he
‘was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.
Sonfusticate and bebother these dwarves!” he said
aloud. “Why don’t they come and lend a hand?” Lo and
behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the
kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he
could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of
small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen
dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside,
nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away),
and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary
and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and
ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they
pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to
collect the plates and glasses.

“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he said in his
politest unpressing tones.


“Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like you,
Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open
the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur,
Bombur, and especially Thorin!

“At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur
standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods
and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long
silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously
important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin
Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling
flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top
of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and
heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing,
about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so
many times, that at last he grunted “pray don’t mention
it,” and stopped frowning.

“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the
row of thirteen hoods—the best detachable party
hoods—and his own hat hanging on the pegs. “Quite a
merry gathering! I hope there is something left for the
late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? Tea! No thank

you! A little red wine, I think for me.”
“And for me,” said Tho
“And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” sai
“And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur.
“And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur.
“And more cakes—and ale—and coffee, if you don’t
mind,” called the other dwarves through the door.


stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever,
and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it
was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was
wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob,
before they were all inside, bowing and saying “at your
service” one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and
Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods,
agrey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hang-
ing on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad
hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the
others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some
called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and
all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for
awhile.

A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the
seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a
round of buttered scones, when there came—a loud
knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beau-
tiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!

Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and alto-
gether bewildered and bewuthered—this was the most
awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled
‘open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top
of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was
Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He
hhad made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also,
by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put
there the morning before.

hung his red one next to it, and “Balin at your service!
he said with his hand on his breast.

“Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the
correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had
flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to
know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask
them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes
might run short, and then he—as the host: he knew his
duty and stuck to it however painful—he might have to

go without,
»me along in, and have some tea!” he managed to
say after taking a deep breath.

“A little beer would suit me better, if i is all the same to
you, my good sir,” said Balin with the white beard. “But
I don’t mind some cake—seed-cake, if you have any.”

“Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his own
surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the
cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then to a pantry to fetch
two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that
afternoon for his after-supper morsel.

‘When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at
the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were
brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in
front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again,
and then another ring.

“Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as he
puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more
dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow


“Lam so sorry to keep you waiting!” he was g
say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a
dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and
very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon as
the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had
been expected.

He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and
“Dwalin at your service!” he said with a low bow.

“Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit, too surprised
to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence
that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: “I am

just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me.”
A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what
would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his
things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

‘They had not been at table long, in fact they had
hardly reached the third cake, when there came another
even louder ring at the bell.

“Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off he went to the

door.
'0 you have got here at last!” That was what he was
going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf,
Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step
with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped
inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been.

“I see they have begun to arrive already,” he said when
he caught sight of Dwalin’s green hood hanging up. He

‘Very amusing for me, very good for you—and profitable
100, very likely, if you ever get over it.”

“Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank you. Not
today. Good morning! But please come to tea—any time
you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good
bye!” With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his
round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not
to seem rude. Wizards after all are wizards.

“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he said to
himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only just had
breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of
something would do him good after his fright.

Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the
door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he
stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a
queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful green front-door.
‘Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was
finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he
had escaped adventures very well.

‘The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf.
He did not remember things very well, unless he put
them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf
Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to
do anything of the kind.

Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on
the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed

and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and
saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.

such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and gob-
lins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unex-
pected luck of widows’ sons? Not the man that used to
make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember
those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's
Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and
snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the
twilight all evening!” You will notice already that
Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe,
also that he was very fond of flowers. “Dear me!” he went
on. “Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many
quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad
adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting
elves—or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless
ime, life used to be quite inter—I mean, you used to upset
things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your
pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.”

“Where else should I be?” said the wizard. “All the
same I am pleased to find you remember something
about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly,
at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed for your
old grandfather Took’s sake, and for the sake of poor
Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for.”

All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was
an old man with a staff. Hee had a tall pointed blue hat, a
long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white
beard hung down below his waist, and immense black
boots.

“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant it. The
sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But
Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows
that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish me a
good morning, or mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not; of that you feel good this
morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?”

“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very fine
morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bar-
gain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a
fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before

his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that.

over The Hill.

“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no time to

very difficult to find anyone.”

“I should think so—in these parts! We are plain quiet

AN UNEXPECTED PARTY

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty,
dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an
‘oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing
in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and
that means comfort.

Ithad a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted
green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact
middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a
tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with
panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided
with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats
and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel
‘wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many
miles round called it—and many little round doors


opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.
No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms,
cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole
rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all
‘were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage.
The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (goin
for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set
round windows looking over his garden, and meadows

This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his
name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neigh-
bourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people
considered them very respectable, not only because most
of them were rich, but also because they never had any
adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell
what a Baggins would say on any question without the
bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins
had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying
things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the
neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see
whether he gained anything in the end.

The mother of our particular hobbit—what is a
hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowa-
days, since they have become rare and shy of the Big
People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people,
about half our height, and smaller than the bearded
Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no
magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort


which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when
large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along,
making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile
off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress
bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no

shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and
thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads
(which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-
natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially
after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can
get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was
saying, the mother of this hobbit— of Bilbo Baggins, that.
is—was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three
remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hob-
bits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran
at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other fami-
lies) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have
taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but cer-
tainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike

about them, and once in a while members of the Took-
clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly dis-
appeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact.
remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the
Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.

Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures
after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was
Bilbo’s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for
her money) that was to be found

folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing
uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can’t
think what anybody sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins,
and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out
another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his
morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no
more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was
not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the
old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and
gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo
got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.

“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t want any
adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill
or across The Water.” By this he meant that the conver-
sation was at an end.

“What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!”
said Gandalf, “Now you mean that you want to get rid
of me, and that it won't be good till I move off.”

“Not atall, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don’t
think I know your name?”

“Yes, yes, my dear sir—and I do know your name,
Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though
you don’t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf,
and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived
to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took’s son, as if 1
was selling buttons at the door!”

“Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the
wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic

beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a
spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to
open—Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.

“What can I do for you, my dwarves?” he said.
” added
the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and
bowed.

“Kili at your service!” said the one. “And

“At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo, remem-
bering his manners this time.

“Dwalin and Balin here already, see,” said Kili. “Let
us join the throng!”

“Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. “I don’t like the sound
of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my.
wits, and have a drink.” He had only just had a sip—in the
corner, while the four dwarves sat round the table, and

talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins,
and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things
which he did not understand, and did not want to, for
they sounded much too adventurous—when, ding-dong-
a-ling-dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty litle
hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off.

“Someone at the door!” he said, blinking.

“Some four, I should say by the sound,” said Fili
“Besides, we saw them coming along behind us in the
distance.

The poor litte hobbit sat down in the hall and put his
head in his hands, and wondered what had happened,
and what was going to happen, and whether they would al


“Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We shan’t get
through the business till late, and we must have some
music first. Now to clear up!”

Thereupon the twelve dwarves—not Thorin, he was
too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf—jumped
to their feet, and made tall piles of all the things. Off they
‘went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates,
each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the
hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright:
“please be careful!” and “please, don’t trouble! I can
manage.” But the dwarves only started to sing:

Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
That's what Bilbo Baggins bates
Smash the bottles and burn the corks!

Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
Pour the milk on the pantry floor!

Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
Splash the wine on every door!

Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;
Pound them up with a thumping pole;
And when you've finished, if any are whole,

Send them down the hall to roll!

That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!
So, carefully! carefully with the plates!

Forancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard

They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they bung
The dragon-fir, in twisted wire

They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And barps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was re, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
‘And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon’ ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

lost on pork ?- Why can't the widow get back her silver snuff-
box that was stole? Why can’t Miss Watson fat up? No,
says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it, I went and told the
widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by
praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” ‘This was too many for
me, but she told me what she meant—I must help other
people, and do everything I could for other people, and look
‘out for them all the time, and never think about myself, ‘This
was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I'went out in the
‘woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't
see no advantage about it—except for the other people—so at
last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just
let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side
and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth
water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and
knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was
two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable
show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got
him there warn’t no help for him any more. I thought it all
out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's, if he wanted
me, though I couldn't make out how he was agoing to be any
better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so igno-
rant and so kind of low-down and ornery.

in the river drowned, about twelve mile above town, so people
said. ‘They judged it was him, anyway ; said this drowned man

“Now welll start this band of robbers and call it ‘Tom
Senyer’s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take
an oath, and write his name in blood.”

Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper
that he had wrote the oath ou, and read it. It swore every
ny to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets
itanybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever
boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it,
ani he mustn’t eat and he musta’t sleep till he had killed them
and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the
tand, And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use
that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it
again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the
Jund told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then
tave his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around,
aul bis name blotted off of the list with blood and never men-
timed again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be
fingot, for ever.
srybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom
it he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the
rest was out of pirate books, and robber books, and every gang
that was high-toned had it.

Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys
that told the secrets. ‘Tom said it was a good idea, so he took
yencil and wrote it in, ‘Then Ben Rogers sy

upagain by-and-by, though I wished he wouldn't.

We played robbers now and then about a month, and then I
reigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, we
dat killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to
hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drovers and
women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never
hived any of them, ‘Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,” and
‘he called the turnips and stuff « julery,” and we would go to the
cave and pow-wow over what we had done and how many people
wehad killed and marked, But I couldn't see no profit in it.
One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing
stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the

was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor,
and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black
cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and
pictures, made with charcoal. ‘There was two old dirty calico
dresses,and a sun-bonnet,and some women’s under-clothes, hang-
ing against the wall, and some men’s clothing, too. We put the
lot into the canoe ; it might come good. There was a boy's
old speckled straw hat on the floor ; I took that too. And
there was a bottle that had had milk in it; and it had ang
stopper for a baby to suck, We would a took the bottle, but
it was broke. ‘There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair
trunk with the hinges broke. ‘They stood open, but. there
warn't nothing left in them that was any account. ‘The way
things was scattered about, we reckoned the people left. ina
hurry and warn't fixed 20 as to carry off most of their stuff,

We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher knife without any
handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any
store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a
gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bed-quilt off the bed, and
areticule with needles aud pins and beeswax and buttons and
thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails,
and a fish-line as thick as my little finger, with some monstrous
hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,
and a horse-shoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have
no label on them ; and just as we was leaving I found a toler-
able good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bor,
and a wooden leg. ‘The straps was broke off of it, but. barring
that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me
and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other
one, though we hunted all around.

And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When
we was ready to shove off, we was a quarter of a mile below the
island, and it was pretty broad day ; so I made Jim lay down


till at last it was over the ban ‘The water was three or four
foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois
bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide ; but on
the Missouri side it was the same old distance across—a half
a mile—beeause the Missouri shore was just a wall of high
bluffs.

Daytimes we paddled alll over the island in the canoe. It
‘was mighty copl and shady in the deep woods even if the sun
was blazing outside. We went winding in and out. amongst the
trees ; and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back
away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down
‘tree you could see rabbits, and snakes, and such things; and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two, they got so
tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right
up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the
snakes and turtles—they would slide off in the water. ‘The
ridge our cavern was in was full of them, We coulda had pets
enough if we'd wanted them.

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice
pine planl ‘It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or
teen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven
inches, a solid level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the
daylight, sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show our-
selves in daylight.

Another night, when we was up at the head of the island,
just before daylight, here comes a frame house down, on the
west side. She was a two-storey, and tilted over, considerable.
We paddled out and got aboard—clumb in at an upstairs win-
dow. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe
fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

‘The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the
island. ‘Then we looked in at the window. We could make
out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things


Me tore it up, and says:

“I'l give you something better—I'll give you a cowhide.”

He set. there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and
then he says

« Ain't you a sweet-scented dandy, though ? A bed ; and
bedelothes ; and a look'n-glass ; and a piece of carpet on the
ttoor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the
tanyard. I never see such a son, I bet I'll take some 0° these
frills out 0° you before I'm done with you. Why, there ain’t no
end to your airs—they siy you're rich, Hey ?—how's that ?”

“They lie—that’s how.”

“Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing
about all T ean stand, now—so don't gimme no sass. I've been
in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you
bein’ rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. ‘That's
why Eeome. You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.”

“Thain't got no money.”

“Isa lie. Judge Thatcher's got it. You git it. I want

“I hain't got no money, T tell you. You ask Judge ‘That

“All right. I'll ask him; and I'l make him pungle, too,

or P11 know the reason why. Say—how much you got in your
poeket ? I want it,

“TL hain't got ouly a dollar, and I want that to—"

“It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you just
shell it out.”

He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said

he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't
hhad a drink all day. When he had got out on the shed, he put

ing to be better than him and when I reckoned he was gone,
he came back and put his head in again, and told me to mind


He got to hanging around the widow's too much, and so
she told him at last, that if he didn’t quit using around there
she would make trouble for him. Well, wasn’t he mad? He
said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss. So he watched
‘out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took
me up the river about three mile, in a skiff, and crossed over
to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no
houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was s0
thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.

He kept me with him all the time, and Inever got a chance
torun off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked
the door and put the key under his head, nights. He hada
gun which he-had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted,
and that was what we lived on, Every little while he locked
me in and went down to the store, three miles to the ferry,
and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and
got drank and had a good time, and licked me. ‘The widow
she found out where I was by-and-by, and she sent a man over
to try to get hold of me, but. pap drove him off with the gun,
and it warn’t long after that till I was used to being where I
was, and liked it, all but the cowhide part.

It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day,
smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. ‘Two months or
more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and
I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's,
where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and
go to bed and get up regular, and be for ever bothering over a
book and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time:
I didn’t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing,
because the widow didn’t like it ; but now I teok to it again
because pap hadn't no objections. It was pretty good times
up in the woods there, take it all around.

But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I


through a jint o' stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—sueh a hat for
ime to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town, if could
git my rights,

“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful gorment, wonderfal. Why,
looky here. There was a free nigger there, from Ohic
nulatter, most as white as a white man, He had the whitest
‘birt en you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat ; and there
sidt a man in that town that’s got as fine clothes as what he
fad and he bad a gold watch and chain, and
cane—the awfullest old grey-heated nabob in the State. And
what do you think? they said he was a p'fessor in a college,
and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.
And that ain't the wust. They said he could vote, when
wasat home. Well, that let me out. ‘Thinks I, what is the
country a-coming to? It was ‘lection day, and I was just about
to go and vote, myself, if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but
when they told me there was a State in this country where
theyid let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never
vwte agin. ‘Them’s the very words I said they all heard me 5
and the country may rot for all me—T'llnever vote agin as long

you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold

there that long yet. ‘There, now—that's a specimen. ‘They
callthat a govment that can’t sell a free nigger till he’s been

ment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months

‘hinted free nigger, and —"


He unlocked the door and I cleared out, up the river bank.
I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down,
and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to
rise, I reckoned I would have great times, now, if I was over
at the town. ‘The June rise used to be always luck for me;
because as soon as that rise begins, here comes cord-wood float-
ing down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs
together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them
to the wood yards and the sawmill.

I went* along up the bank with one eye out for pap and
Cother one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all
at once, here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen
‘or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. Ishot head first
‘off of the bank, like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out
for the canoe, I just expected there'd be somebody laying
down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and
when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up
and laugh at him, But it warn't so this time. It was a drift
‘canoe, sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.
Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s
worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn't in
sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a
gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another
idea ; I judged I'd hide her good, and then, stead of taking to
the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mi
and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough,
tramping on foot.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and T thought T heard
the old man coming, all the time; but I got her hid; and
then Tout and looked around a bunch of willows, and there
was the old man down the path apiece just drawing a bead on
a bird with his gun. So he hadn't seen anything.

When he got along, I was hard at it taking up a * trot”

a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked
T could peep through.

By-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that
they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most every-
body was on the boat, Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie
‘Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt
Polly, and Sid and and plenty more, Everybody was
talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:

“Look sharp,now; the current sets in the closest here, and
maybe he’s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush
at the water's edge. I hope so, anyway.

I didn't hope so. ‘They all crowded up and leaned over the
rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their
‘ht, Teould see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.
‘Then the captain sung out:

Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right
before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near
blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they'd
hhad some bullets in, I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was
after. Well, I see I warn’t hurt, thanks to goodness. ‘The
boat floated on ard went out of sight around the shoulder of
the island, Icould hear the booming, now and then, farther
and further off, and by-and-by after an hour, I didn’t hear it
no more. ‘The island was three mile long. I judged they had
got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn’t yet a-
while. ‘They turned around the foot of the island and started
up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming
‘once in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and
‘watched them, When they got abreast the head of the ishand
they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and
went home to the town.

I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-
hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made


and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away
into the sky, not a cloud in it. ‘The sky looks ever so deep
when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never
knowed it before. And how fur a body can hear on the water
such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I
heard what they said, too, every word of it, One man said it
‘was getting towards the long days and the short nights, now.
other one said this warn't one of the short ones, he reckoned
—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they
laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told
him, and laughed, but he didn’t. langh ; he ripped out some-
thing brisk and said let him alone. The first fellow said he
‘lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was pretty
good; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had
said in his time. I heard one man say it was neatly three
elock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a
week longer. After that, the talk got farther and further away,
aud T couldn't make out the words any more, but I could hear
the mumble; and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a
long ways off.

Twas away below the ferry now. I rose up and there was
Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy-
timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big
and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There
wam't any signs of the bar at the head—it was all under water
nor.

It didn’t take me long to get there. I shot past the head
ata ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into
the dead water and landed on the side towards the Tlinois
shore, [ run the eanoe into a deep dent in the bank that T
hnowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get ins
aud when T made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the
outside,


after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this
fellow and took him into camp.

I took the axe and smashed in the door, I beat it and
hacked it considerable, a-doing it. I fetched the pig in and
took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throst
with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed—I sy
ground, beeause it wax ground-—hard packed, and no boanis.
Well, next I took aa old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it,—
all I could drag—and I started it from the pig and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped
it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that
something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom
Sawyer was there, I knowed he would take an interest in this
ind of business, and throw in the fancy touches, Nobody
could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.

Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and bloodied the
axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe inthe
comer. ‘Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with
my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I gota good piece below the
house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of
something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old
saw out of the canoe and fetched them tothe house. I took the
bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom
of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the
place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife, about the
‘cooking. ‘Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across
the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow
Jake that was five miles wide and full of rushes—and ducks too,
you might say, in the season. ‘There was a slough or a creek
leading out of it on the other side, that went miles away,
don’t know where, but it didn't go to the river. ‘The mel
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. /
dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had


roust me out, you hear? ‘That man warn't here for no good.
Ta shot him, Next time, you ronst me out, you hear?”

‘Then he dropped down and went to sleep again—but what
he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to
myself, I can fix it now 80 nobody won't think of following me.

About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the
bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of drift-
‘wood going by on the rise. By-and-by, along comes part of a
log raft—nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff
and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner, Anybody but pap
would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more
stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style. Nine logs was enough for
one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he
locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft
about half-past three. I judged he wouldn't eome back that
night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start, then
T out with my saw and went to work on that log again. Before
he was Uother side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and
his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.

I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe
was hid, and shoved the vinesand branches apart and put it in
then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky
jing; I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the
ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and
gourd, I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two
hlaukets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines
and matches and other things—everything that was worth a
cent. I cleaned out the place, I wanted an axe, but there
wasn’t any, only the one out at the wood pile, and I knowel
why I was going toleave that. I fetched out the gun, and no
T was done.

T had wore the ground a good deal, crawling out of the hole
and dragging out so many things, So I fixed that as good as


been done by accident, Then I tied up the rip in the meal
sack with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and
my saw to the canoe a

Tt was about dark, now; s0 T dropped the canoe down the
river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited
for the moon to rise. I made fast toa willow; then I took a
bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to smoke
pipe and lay out a plan, I says to myself, they'll follow the
track of that. sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the
river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake
and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the
robbers that killed me and took the things. ‘They won't ever
hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. ‘They'll soon
get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me, All
rights Tean stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good
enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody
ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town, nights,
and slink around and pick up things I want, Jackson’s Island's
the place.

I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed, I was
asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where I was, for a
minute. I set up and looked around, a little seared. Then I
remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. ‘The
moon was 0 bright I could a counted the drift logs that went
a slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and
melt late. You know what { mean—I don’t know the words
to put it in.

T took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to un-
hitch and start, when I heard a sound away over the water. I
listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of
‘a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when
it’s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches,


“1 laid dah under de shaving all day. 1 ‘uz hungry, but
warn't afeared ; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz

“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en

“T see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p'int, bymeby, so I wade’ in

time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply,
cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the
night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and
brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out
‘and into the edge of the woods, I set down there on a log and
looked out through the leaves. I sge the moon go off watch
and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little
while I see a pale streak over the tree-tops, and knowed the
day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards
where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute
or two to listen, Bat I hadn't no luck, somehow; I couldn't
seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I eatched
a glimpse of fire, away throngh the trees. I went for it, cautious
and slow. By-and-) close enough to have a look, and
there laid a man on the ground, It most give me the fan-tods.
He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in
the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six
foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting
gray daylight, now. Pretty soon he gapped, and stretched
himself, and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's
Jim! T bet T was glad to see him. I says:

« Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.

He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops
down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:

Doan’ hurt me—don’t! I hain’t ever done no harm to a
ghos’, Iawluz liked dead people, en done all 1 could for "em.
‘You go en git in de river agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do
nuffin to Ole Jim, ’at "uz awluz yo" fren’.”

Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn’t dead.”
Iwas ever so glad to see Jim. Twarn't lonesome, now. I told
him I warn't afraid of iim telling the people where I was. I
talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never
said nothing. Then I says:


‘mea nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent
‘out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't
getat them. I catched a cat-fish and haggled him open with
ny saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for break-
fast.

When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feel~
ing pretty satisfied ; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and
I went and set on the bank and listened to the currents
wubing along, and counted the stars and drift-logs and rafts
that come down, and then went to bed; there ain't no better
vay to put in time when you are lonesome ; you can't stay #0,
you soon get over it.

And so for three days and nights. No difference—just the
same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down
through the island, I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so
tosay, and I wanted to know all about it ; but mainly I wanted
to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and
prime; and green summer-grapes, and green razberries ; and
the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
ould all come handy by-and-by, I judged.

Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged
Iwarn't far from the foot of the island, I had my gun along,
tut I hadn't shot nothing; it was for protection ; thought I
would kill some game nigh home, About this time I mighty
near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding of
through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a
shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded
right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.

‘My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited
for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking
back on my tip-toes as fast as ever I could. Every now and
then I stopped a sccond, amongst the thick leaves, and listened ;


and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner.
By-and-by he raised up, part way, and listened, with his head
to one side. He says very low

“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp
—tramp ; they'recoming after me ; but I won't go— Oh, they're
here! don't touch me—don't! hands off—they're cold ; let go—
Oh, let a poor devil alone!”

‘Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them
to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and
wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging ; and
then he went to crying. I could hear him through the
blanket.

By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking
wild, and he see me and went forme, He chased me round and
round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death,
and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no
more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck, but he laughed
such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on
chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under
his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my
shoulders, and I thought I’ was gone; but I slid out of the
jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he
‘was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the
door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He
put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong,
and then he would see who was who.

So he dozed off, pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-
bottom chair and clumb up, as easy as I could, not to make any
noise, and got down the gun, I slipped the ramrod down it to
make sure it was loaded, and then I laid it across the turnip
barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait
for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag
along.

snow he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise,
anddown he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his
toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
ecerdone previous. He said so his own self, afterwanls, He
lad heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it
hid over him, too; but [reckon that was sort of piling it on,
maybe,

After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough
whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. ‘That
wasalways his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in
stout an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself
cut, one or other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down
ou bis blankets, by-and-by ; but luck didn’t run my way. He
4ida't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned, and
vooaned, and thrashed around this way and that, for a long time.
At last T got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open, all T
could do, and 0 before { knowed what I was about I was sound
asleep, and the candle burning.

Tdon't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden
there was an awful scream and [was up. ‘There was pap,
looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling
stout snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and
thea he would gi mp and scream, and say one had bit
lim oa the cheek—but I couldn't see no snakes. He started.
sad ran round and round the cabin hollering “take him off!
take him off ! he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man
look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and
fel down panting; then he rolled over and over, wonderful
fas, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing
tthe air with his hands, and screaming, and saying there was
‘isvils ahold of him, He wore out, by-and-by, and laid still a
while, moaning. ‘Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.
T cold hear the owls and the wolves, away off in the woods


I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk
enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn't
notice how long I was staying, till the old man hollered and
asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about
dark, While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or
two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again.
He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all
night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought
lhe was Adam, he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun
to work, he most always went for the govment. ‘This time he
says:

Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s
like, Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away
from him—a man’s ofn son, which he has had all the trouble
and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just
as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to
work and begin to do suthin’ for him and give him a rest, the
law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! ‘That
ain't all, nuther. ‘The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and
Lelps him to keep me out o” my property. Here's what the
Taw does. ‘The law takes a man worth six thousand dollar
upards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this,
lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. ‘They
call that govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment
like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the
country for good and all. Yes, and I told "em told old
Thatcher so to his face. Lots of “em heard me, and can tell
what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country
and never come anear it agin, Them’s the very words. I says,
ook at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and
the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't
rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up

40 THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLERERRY FL

veork. ‘There was an old horte-blanket mailed against the loge
atthe far end of the cabin behind ¢he table, to keep the wind
from blowing through the chinks and putting the eande’ out.
1 got under the table and mised the Manket and went to
‘work to saw a section of the big bottom log out, big enough to
let me through. Well, it was good long job, bat I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard paps gus in the woods. 1
fot rid ofthe signs of my work, and dropped the blanket aod
Tid my sy and pretty soon pap come in.

Pap arn't in a good humour he was his natural self,
He sit he was down to town, and everything was going wrong.
is lawyer said he reckoned he: would ‘win his lawsuit and get
the money, if they ever got started on the tral; but then
there war ways to put it ofa long time, and Judge Tha
knoe how to doit. And he said people allowed there'd be
another tral to get me away from him and give me to the
widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win, this
time. ‘This shook me up considerable, because T didn’ want
to go back tothe widow's any more aude so cramped wp, sd
siviljned, as they called it. Then the old aman got to using,
and casted everything and everybody he could think of, and
‘then cussed them all over agai to make sre he hadatskippet
‘any, and after that he polished off with a kind ofa general enss
all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he
dida’t know the names of, and so called them whathis-tame,
‘when he got to them, and went right along with his eusing.

He sai he would ike to see the widow get me. He mid
the would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game
co him he knowed of a place six or seven mile of to stow me
in wbere they might hunt tll they dropped and they couldn?
find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only fora
rinute; I reekoned 1 wouldn't stay on land till be got that


about that school, because he was going to lay for me and liek
me if I didn’t drop that.

Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's
and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the
money, but he couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law
foree

‘The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to
take mie away from him and let one of them be my guardian ;
‘hut it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn’t know
the old man; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate
families if they could help it; said he'd druther not take a
child away from its father. So Judge ‘Thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business.

‘That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest. He said he'd
cowhide me till T was black and blue if I didn’t raise some
money for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher,
and pap took it and got drank and went a-blowing around and
cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all
‘over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed
him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him
again for a week. But he said he was satisfied ; said he was
boss of his son, and he’d make it warm for him.

When he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make
aman of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed
him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner
and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to
speak, And after supper he talked to him about temperance
and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a
fool, and fooled away his life ; but now he was agoing to tarn
over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of,
and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on
him. ‘The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he
cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he'd been a man


was white ; not like another man’s white, but a white to make
abody sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a tree-toad
white, a fish-belly white, As for his clothes—just rags, that
wasall, He had one ankle resting on tother knee; the boot
on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through,
and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on
the floor; an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a
tid,

I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me,
with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down, I
voticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed.
He kept a-looking me all over. By-and-by he say:

“Starchy clothes—very. You think you're a good deal of
abig-bug, don’t you?”

“Maybe Iam, maybe I ain't,” I says.

“Don't you give me none o’ your lip,” says he,“ You've
pat on considerble many frills since I been away. I'll take

“The widow, She told me.”

“The widow, hey ?—and who told the widow she could put
in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business ?”

“Nobody never told her.”

“Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—

was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and. Jim
could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was
for putting our traps in there, right away, but I said we didn't
‘want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

‘Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had
all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody
‘was to come to the island, and they would never find us with-
‘out dogs. And besides, he said them little birds had said it
was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet ?

So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast
the cavern, and iugged all the traps upthere. ‘Then we hunted
up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick
willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again,
and begun to get ready for dinner.

‘The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead
in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit
and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it
there and cooked dinner.

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our
dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the
back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up and begun to
thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it. Direetly
it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never
see the wind blow so, It was one of these regular summer
storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black out-
side, and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick
that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby ;
and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees
down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a
perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches
to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when
it was just about the bluest and blackest—fet! it was as bright
as glory and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging


‘rent to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of
used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me.
Living in a house, and sleeping in a bed, pulled on ine pretty
tight, mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out
aad sleep in the woods, sometimes, and so that was a rest to
me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so [ liked
the new ones, too, a little bit. ‘The widow said I was coming
along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she

One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at
breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could, to
throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but.
Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off, She
says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry—what a mess you
are always making!” ‘The widow put in a good word for me,

and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me,
and what it was going to be. ‘There is ways to keep off some
kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t one of them kind; so I never
tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on
the watch-out.
